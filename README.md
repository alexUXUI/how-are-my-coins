## What does it do? ðŸ¤”

> Though the App is currently in development, the road map contians two ðŸ”‘ features.

* To allow the user to create a user account
  - This functionality is just so that  `How Are My Coins` can remember whom created which Altfolio.

* Allow users to create a sample Altfolio by specifing: 
  - Which curriencies should be in the Altfolio
  - How much of each currency should be in there

##### Idea: ðŸ’¡
> To accomplish two things:

* Allow me to go to **one** place to get an idea of how my +20 crypto currencies are doing
* Allow me to play around with and build experiemental ALtfolios without having to sign up for anything or use real money,

### Backend Application:

Right now the API has two endpoints:

1) `/users` 
  - GET: Will return two collections:
    - Users
    - Altfolios
2) `/coins`
  - GET: Will return one collection:
    - Coin Market Cap, coin data

```sh
$ cd hamc-express
$ yarn start or nodemon (whichever you prefer)
